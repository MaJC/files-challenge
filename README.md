Hi Kristen,

Here is my repository with a HTML file talking about Daryl Dixon, my favorite fictional character, from the TV series
The Walking Dead. Maybe you enjoy The Walking Dead as much as I do but if not, I hope you learned a little something about the 
amazing TV series from my HTML file.

Sincerely,
Charles Ma
