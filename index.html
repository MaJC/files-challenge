			Daryl Dixon is a main character in the TV series "The Walking Dead". He is a survivor of the virus outbreak and
			is part of Rick Grimes's group. Daryl has very strong survival, hunting, and crossbow skills making him an integral member
			of Rick's group. His relations with the other members of the group have been getting better in each season, but he still remains the cool-headed lone wolf of the group.
